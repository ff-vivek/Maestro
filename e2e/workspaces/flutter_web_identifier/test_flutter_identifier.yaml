# Test Flutter Web with flt-semantics-identifier support
# This test demonstrates how Maestro can now use Flutter's stable identifiers

- launchApp

# Wait for page to load
- assertVisible: "Flutter Web Identifier Test Page"

# Test 1: Use flutter-id selector for Flutter identifiers on text fields
- tapOn:
    flutter-id: "username_field"
- inputText: "testuser123"

- tapOn:
    flutter-id: "email_field"
- inputText: "test@example.com"

# Test 2: Use flutter-id selector for checkbox
- tapOn:
    flutter-id: "agree_checkbox"

# Verify checkbox is checked
- assertVisible: "✓ I agree to the terms and conditions"

# Test 3: Use flutter-id selector for button
- tapOn:
    flutter-id: "submit_button"

# Verify form submission
- assertVisible: "Form Submitted Successfully!"
- assertVisible: "Username: testuser123"
- assertVisible: "Email: test@example.com"
- assertVisible: "Agreed to terms: Yes"

# Test 4: Use flutter-id selector for cancel button
- tapOn:
    flutter-id: "cancel_button"

# Verify form is cleared
- assertNotVisible: "Form Submitted Successfully!"

# Test 5: Test tab selection using Flutter identifiers
- tapOn:
    flutter-id: "profile_tab"

# Verify tab is selected (should have aria-selected="true")
- assertVisible:
    flutter-id: "profile_tab"
    selected: true

- tapOn:
    flutter-id: "settings_tab"

- assertVisible:
    flutter-id: "settings_tab"
    selected: true

# Test 6: Combine flutter-id selector with other selectors
- tapOn:
    flutter-id: "submit_button"
    enabled: true

- assertVisible: "Form Submitted Successfully!"
